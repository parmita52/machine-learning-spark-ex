# ML Spark Walkthrough Tutorial
This tutorial walks through a basic Machine Learning example from start to finish. It explains critical big ideas in ML and goes into specifics of how to use the Apache Spark ML Pipelines for implementation. 

If you already know the basics of ML and just want to learn about Spark Pipelines, feel free to skip to the Spark Pipeline Explanation Section.
